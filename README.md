# MasterThesis

Part from the code for one of the experiments during my final year at the MSc "Digital Media & Computational Intelligence" This is the final step during the process of the creation of a surrogate model, built upon SEOBNRv4 model of waveforms. During the series of experiments that were tried out, this is the idea where we divided the range of one of the input parameters in order to obtain better results. Two seperate trainings took place, one for the amplitude and one for the phase components of the complex waveform. The final errors measurement takes place, in the script where we combine our reconstructed waveforms from the models' predictions and obtain the final mismatch.
